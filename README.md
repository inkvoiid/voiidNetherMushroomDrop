inkvoiid's Nether Mushroom Drop Datapack

This datapack changes warped fungi to drop the respective mushroom instead for renewablility.

Block drop loot tables:
- The blocks drops one mushroom per block and isn't increased by fortune as to not overflow with items.
- Nether wart blocks also randomly drop a nether wart at a rate **similarâ„¢** to apples from leaves.
- Warped wart blocks **do not** drop nether warts.

Crafting:
- You can use 4 fungi to craft the respective block
- You **can not** craft the blocks back into fungi which means:
  - A block crafted from 4 blocks will only give you **1** fungi back
- This encourages players to use that fungi to grow another giant mushroom to get more blocks.

You are free to use this datapack.
You are free to share and/or modify this pack **as long as** you give credit referring back to this repository.
